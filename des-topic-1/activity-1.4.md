Size and culture are two factors that play a significant part in the creation and structuring of any business. When it comes to those operating in the IT industry, there are numerous factors to take into account when deciding whether or not to have a division specialized in innovation.‌  
For a business to have specific roles focused on forward thinking and future proofing would affect the structure of a company in a few ways, namely by requiring a new individuals, teams or departments that are employed to develop these ideas and concepts for the company. This department would have to be in contact with upper management to present the concepts so the company can advance, but they could also serve as a middle man for employees to give their input to, rather than trying to pitch to bosses or CEOS.‌ This would save time for all parties involved.‌  
Other factors that affect the culture and structure are dependent on the size of the business. This can affect the structure in a variety of ways, for example, smaller businesses would not find it as arduous to have an important roundtable discussion between all members of the business, simply for the fact that it is easy to get everyone in the same room, under the same roof. For a larger business this would be a more challenging proposition and its why the middle-managers and various team leaders are required.
