IT is now all around us, and fairly unavoidable as an aspect off business. unless you are a lemonade stall, any business these days needs to utilize IT. Even setting up a point of sale device and computers and what not used to scan customers products, if its a store.

If a company has a database of customers, or even their own employees, that needs to be managed. Then when you have things going on like storing personal information, or login details, you obviously need security. I dont know the stats for sure but I could easily estimate that 99% of businesses of all kinds, would operate a website. It brings in more customers and is a very useful tool for people to find out about your business. If you're thinking about accessibility, and depending on the kind of company you are and services you provide, you could also think about having a mobile app. People are attached to their smartphones these days and an app is an easy way they can connect with you.

Office employees all use computers, and they all need to be setup professionally and user accounts, as well as any technical issues, need to be managed. So already we have multiple areas which IT is integrated into running a business, and what is required in this modern age to run something.

There are costs involved obviously, and hardware, software, servers, and employment costs of consultants and possibly IT management team as well if you are outsourcing it. Maintaining this is an ongoing cost that businesses must budget for.
