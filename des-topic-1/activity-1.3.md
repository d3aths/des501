# activity 1.3

Although there aren't many on trademe/seek and in new zealand, i have seen a few come up from time to time for roles working within a game development company. this has always been my highest area of interest and ive taken a certificate in game design over in australia where i designed my own stuff, made a couple for that. one just a single screen game and the other a big project that took almost the whole year to build up about 10-15mins of gameplay, but i made everything asides from the assets myself.

so as i have experience in that i can definitely say im interested in getting into world design or level design. theres one website i know that deals specially in gaming jobs, however its international so i feel like i would need experience locally before i look at that. level design was a lot of fun and my favourite part about it, due to the nature of the cert being online i didnt have much help in figuring out how to code for myself so mostly relied in putting it together using hotpotch youtube tutorials, ended up being super stressful but maybe once i learn more coding it could be an option i wouldnt mind getting into as well, being a developer and building the gears that run the game.

asides from both of those options i also think security would be an interesting option for career, but i know very little about that so looking forward to later in my degree when i get to take that class.
