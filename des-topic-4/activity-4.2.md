Usability and UX differ from each other by the fact that UX is more how the user feels when using the site, ie frustrated, or impressed. How they move around the site and can find what they need. Whereas usability describes how the site as a whole is usable.

Important things for usability would be the layout of the website ie where the columns of text and pictures and headings are. The contrast of the site and colours used. How many images are on the site. The flow of the text and subjects. How spaced out it all and not cramped up together. Making sure menus contain appropriate categories and things are displayed clearly.

A bad example of website usability would be Square enix's mogstation, shown below

For one thing, the recruit a friend option isn't available on that page where it shows you how many people have been accepted. You have to search for it completely off your account page, only to be taken to a page that looks exactly like above only there is a big button that takes you to the recruit a friend options page. Why can't that just be there in the first place?  
Another huge complaint that I can't really show in a screenshot would be the subscription options. First of all, since Oceanic accounts are tied to the EU region, it only displays sub fees in Euros and you have to pay for everything in euros which the converted to our regions currency, end up being almost double. Secondly since the Oceanic region is tied to EU, it won't let you use a visa card that isn't located from the Europe region. Thirdly, they have another subscription option called Crysta, which isn't even displayed on that page. You have to buy it first and then you can pay for your game time, or custom items from their store, or anything you want on their website. But on the page to buy it, it doesn't show how much you need for your game time. And once you have bought it, its very hard to find the option that lets you buy game time with crysta. And after messing around with all that because apparently it is the cheapest way to pay for the game, I found after going through the checkout, that Crysta wasn't even available for my region.  
There are multiple other grievances I've had with the website over the years, that I can't recall. Its terrible.



A program with good usability would be Blizzard's Battle.net application, shown below.

There we have a menu at the top with the icons for all their games. Clicking on the icon takes you to the launcher page for each one, as you can see from the first example. On the side shows your friend list and what games theyre playing so you can easily see and join them. The middle shows any urgent news like the maintenance with the yellow warning icon, and scrollable news such as updates for each game that you can click on and it takes you to their website with a more detailed information about the news.  
The settings page is also very easily accessible, you can find a dropdown menu in the very top left corner on the blue icon, that also shows you your accounts options as well. This is very easy to use.
