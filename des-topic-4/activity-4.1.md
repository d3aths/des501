So there is probably going to be a lot of challenges when designing a user interface and incorporating good design practices and functions into it.

The accessibility for a start, it needs to be able to be used on all kinds of devices, not just PC. The site needs to be compatible with all kinds of things, including stuff like screen readers for people who have disabilities.

It needs to also be simple to use, simple to find the things that users are looking for, and not having things hidden away under multiple menus or in hard to find areas of the site. For this, you would need to place yourself in the situation of all kinds of people who would access your site. Think of what they could want, how they would use the site, and what their skill level of technology is, for example older people would find it harder to try and find things than younger who are used to technology.

Another challenge would be actually trying to find the opinions of the users of your site, because it could easily be usable for the developers but completely different for users. People aren't going to take the time to bother with a site at all if its too complicated or looks like crap. You could take a survery I suppose and ask them questions about it, but a common practice would be to analyze site traffic, revenue, views etc. However as the article says, results from looking at that kind of thing doesn't actually tell you if its because of the UX or not that numbers could be dipping.

Finally, the UX design has to be specifically tailored to the website and user base. You can't copy in parts of another website you've seen that you think is good, cause it simply won't be the same. It has to be developed in the first place with the specific needs to your own users, and I would say you would have to listen to their feedback and implement solutions to any problems they report back.
