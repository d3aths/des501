these websites offer a variety of services, with the ever growing market leaning towards digital products and everything being digitized, most of these companies are offering you a service to either help your business get online, manage aspects of their business like databases, internet service, security, getting a mobile app made, and the general IT consultants.

the remaining companies are offering products more for the individual consumer, like the game website, the company that makes the online version of plunketbook, and potentially also the e-commerce website, which is marketed towards people looking to start their own business rather than an official company. so thats how i would categorize them, with who their target audiences or consumers, are.
