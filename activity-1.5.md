With all the advancements in modern technology, computers and tech, devices and automation have become more ingrained into our daily lives, especially in the workplace. From offices to shops, warehouses to factories, we're using technology a lot more frequently to help us with our tasks, or even fulfill some of the more manual labour roles that used to be done by hand.

The use of smart phones and online communication platforms can connect companies to teammates around the world, in different divisions of your company, to delegate work and share with each other in realtime. You can have conference calls on skype without even leaving your house. You can work at home by using remote access to your company's server. You could have a whole team collaborating together with each member being in a different location around the world - the employees don't even need to be in an office together anymore. Before tech took over this wasn't at all possible.

Even in mundane places like supermarkets, roles that humans used to fill have been replaced with machines, the self checkouts. Another example would be the use of a service like Github in the workplace. Team members can all work on a repository together, from anywhere, and share their work with each other.

There are a lot of benefits for this integration, including that people can be infinitely more mobile. People can be comfortable in their own environments therefore keep their morale and productivity levels high. There is a lot less menial/manual tasks being carried out by workers, which can be automated by machines or AI instead. It can be easier to learn and solve problems with the internet and the expertise of people from different backgrounds and/or cultures around the world being at your fingertips.
