Find examples of the following:

1. _a simple, uncluttered design -_ that is, a web site or page where interface and image elements have a purpose, and text is kept as concise as possible and easy to read.
2. _a consistent design -_ that is, a web site or page where it is obvious to visitors what to do in that the whole site behaves the same way, has consistent navigation and language style, etc.
3. _a standard design -_ that is, uses a design layout and navigation that's similar to other web sites so visitors know what to do.

This website follows the design of old school forums that used to be popular on the internet about a decade ago. Forums like this are pretty much a relic now, since most video game discussion happens on applications like discord, or general websites such as reddit. However this is a recent website, only appearing about a year ago for the release of the video game it is centered on. I find the layout of this page very pleasant to look at. The images and the style of art the site uses is very nice and clean. Each element of the page is clearly labelled and is easy to navigate on it for a beginner who has just stumbled across the site. It isn't cluttered and uses the whitespace to its advantage.
