Find examples of the following:

1. _a simple, uncluttered design -_ that is, a web site or page where interface and image elements have a purpose, and text is kept as concise as possible and easy to read.
2. _a consistent design -_ that is, a web site or page where it is obvious to visitors what to do in that the whole site behaves the same way, has consistent navigation and language style, etc.
3. _a standard design -_ that is, uses a design layout and navigation that's similar to other web sites so visitors know what to do.

This website follows the design of old school forums that used to be popular on the internet about a decade ago. Forums like this are pretty much a relic now, since most video game discussion happens on applications like discord, or general websites such as reddit. However this is a recent website, only appearing about a year ago for the release of the video game it is centered on. I find the layout of this page very pleasant to look at. The images and the style of art the site uses is very nice and clean. Each element of the page is clearly labelled and is easy to navigate on it for a beginner who has just stumbled across the site. It isn't cluttered and uses the whitespace to its advantage.

Not the website in that link itself, but the list of sites it is referring to. I thought this was the best example showing how many wiki styled websites there are, well not that exactly since theres definitely a lot more than 20, but it shows how popular they are all for users to browse as a source of information for their subject in question. Every wiki website operates with the same layout, the same linking style and search, the same everything, the topic it contains is the only difference, so users are very familiar with this interface.

This e-commerce site is the face of online shopping for the NZ department store chain the warehouse. If we compare it to other NZ store chains such as kmart or briscoes, we see they all follow the standard pattern that is expected from stores like this. As written by Jakob Nielson of nngroup.com, the main standardized elements of sites like this are as follows:  


* A logo in the upper left corner of the page
* A search box on the homepage
* An absence of splash pages
* Breadcrumbs listed horizontally \(when they were used\)

They also all follow the convention of having their shopping categories on a secondary nav bar up top of the screen.
