What makes a good web experience?

* A website that makes you want to spread around how good it is to others
* that you want to stay on for a long time and explore the site, see what there is on it
* A site that makes you want to share your own content to it
* a well-written site that engages with you
* something that has really nice graphical elements to it

Personally i'm very put off by videos on a website. I won't watch videos even on the few social media I use and I barely use youtube unless I really have to. I highly prefer content in pictures and words. Which is increasingly hard to find these days as one of the main things I use the internet for is to look at guides and such about video games, so a lottttt of this content is moving to video which is unfortunate.

Age is definitely a factor as people from older generations, or even people a few years older than university age, have completely different experiences of the internet. For the older people, the websites they grew up with on the internet are far different from the things they experience on the web these days, and they tend to hold fondness or nostalgia for older things.
