Interface elements are the things we interact with on websites to navigate to what we want to see. For instance on a shopping website, usually they will have categories at the top or the side, with an arrow on it, and we know if we click on that, usually a dropdown menu will appear showing us more options. When arriving at a site you could be greeting with a loading icon or progress bar and you know that the content will appear soon. Most mobile apps you use will have a gear icon or a 3-line icon and you know if you tap on that a menu will appear. These are just a few examples of the everyday components of modern websites that we have come to see everywhere across the internet.

For this example, the options on a social media website uses these icons which each have a dropdown menu or action associated with them. The first icon, a house, takes you to the homepage. the second is a compass, which is the explore page. The next two are both messages as shown by the mail and the instant message icon \(mail here is legacy, most people use instant message\) the lightning bolt is somewhat of a non-standard icon but it is for notifications, the next one is your profile and options associated with your account, and the very last one is for making a new post. Most people will be able to instantly look at these icons and know what each does, as they have become fairly standard across most apps and websites like this now.

Another example of what is very standard across any kind of online shopping website. Searching is the main feature on these big marketplace sites, less so on specific company's clothing sites. But as sites like ebay have probably millions of all kinds of items, you can search for your item across any kind of category, and then when you have searched, these other options appear that lets you filter the results. Very straightforward and most internet dwellers are familiar with how to interact with an interface like this.

![overview page for a product](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

In this, we can see an example of a slider. Clicking the different icons for colours, swipes the picture above to showcase the different coloured phones. That particular page, an overview of the OnePlus 8 Pro, also features animation as you scroll down \(which I can't screenshot\). Each new section slides into view and back out again as you scroll.

![an accordion container](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

This example is an accordion container, in which each section is compactly stacked at first, and when clicked on it unfolds to show the information it holds, then when you click a new title the one you have open folds back down to open the new one.



![OSRS Wiki uses typography to create hierarchy](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

A wiki is a very clear example of how different fonts on a page dictate the hierarchy. Here we see a couple different varieties of headers, and subheaders, then body text between them.
