development lifecycles are very important when you have a project being worked on by a team of all kinds of different people. everyone from each department will likely have a different role in the project and a different understanding of their own work compared to the other parts of the lifecycle that they aren't a part of. having a set lifecycle for anything software development related is important for everyone involved to be able to understand the project as a whole, and everyone elses parts of it too.
